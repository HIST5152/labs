## Finding/defining audience with user personas

### Description 
Your upcoming assignment ([Project Proposal Part I: "The Problem and Evidence"](https://github.com/HIST5152/assignments/blob/main/group/project-proposal.md)) asks you, in part, to think deeply about audience. This is the basis of accessible design and coherent, mission-driven project management. Thinking about audience should be embedded within each step of the project's creation.

One tool that can be useful for defining and planning for an audience is a user persona - a representation of the needs of an audience segment. We're going to practice making up some user personas today. You will have time to explore this method with your group project members today. You are not required to use this method for your project, but you might find it helpful.
