## Data sonification with TwoTone

### Description

Why data sonification? (hint: What do Bleeker, et al have to say?)

An excerpt from [Shawn Graham's Programming Historian tutorial on sonification](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sonification):

> "Sonification is the practice of mapping aspects of the data to produce sound signals. In general, a technique can be called ‘sonification’ if it meets certain conditions. These include reproducibility (the same data can be transformed the same ways by other researchers and produce the same results) and what might be called intelligibility - that the ‘objective’ elements of the original data are reflected systematically in the resulting sound (see Hermann 2008 for a taxonomy of sonification). Last and Usyskin (2015) designed a series of experiments to determine what kinds of data-analytic tasks could be performed when the data were sonified. Their experimental results (Last and Usyskin 2015) have shown that even untrained listeners (listeners with no formal training in music) can make useful distinctions in the data. They found listeners could discriminate in the sonified data common data exploration tasks such as classification and clustering. (Their sonified outputs mapped the underlying data to the Western musical scale.)"

### Directions
How data sonification?

Split into groups of 2 (and one with 3)

Open Chrome as your browser and navigate to https://twotone-midiout-beta.netlify.app/

Choose a dataset to sonify - you can also use the provided example datasets
Hints for picking a dataset:
- Time-series data works particularly well because there are natural parallels to musical sound (e.g. sequence, duration)
- A dynamic dataset (lots of ups and downs) will be easier for you to clearly hear the variation
- Picking a dataset you are somewhat familiar with may make interpreting the data with sonification less abstract and more subjectively meaningful

Watch this 5 minute TwoTone interface introduction together: https://twotone.io/tutorials/introduction-to-twotone/

Plug in your dataset and play around! You have 15 minutes.
Some framing questions (also from Graham):
- What tones, sounds, settings make sense given your data?
- How do different choices affect the meaning of what you’ve created?
- Is there anything meaningful?

Tell the class briefly about what you found.
