## Narrative maps with StoryMap.js

### Description 
[StoryMapJS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/) is a free, browser-based tool that allows for relatively simple creation of narrative maps. Narrative maps add dimensions – temporal, spatial, contextual – that can be powerful tools for storytelling. With the interactive StoryMapJS tool, we can enhance the story we tell by embedding or integrating a variety of rich multimedia source material and easily share the end product. I won’t demo this today, but this tool also has a feature that will let you import a custom [“basemap,”](https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/DS/Resources/StoryMapsBasemap) such as those you can find in the georeferenced [David Rumsey Historical Map Collection](https://www.davidrumsey.com/view/georeferenced-maps)

- [Georeferenced maps of Philadelphia](https://www.philageohistory.org/geohistory/)

- [An example StoryMap](https://storymap.knightlab.com/)

### Directions
Create a new GitHub file
- Go to Assignments folder > Add file > Create new file
- Name your file "storymap.md"
- You'll enter in the info below, then commit with your "DONE" comment

Identify a place in Philadelphia that has historical significance to you, personally. Gather the following information and enter it into your GitHub doc:

- the location (you may need to Google for the closest physical address, but do your best) 
- a headline
- text/content for the content box (i.e. why is this site interesting or significant to you?)
- one piece of media (images, URLs for video/audio) and any credits and captions needed

We’ll only take 15 minutes for this process, so don’t stress about perfection. I’ll then walk us through the process of creating a collaborative narrative map. StoryMapJS doesn’t allow multiple people to be logged in at the same time, so I’ll use my account to create the map. I’ll call on you to talk about your map point as I add it to our StoryMap.
