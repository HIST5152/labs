## Exploring contingency with Twine

### Description
I'll introduce you to the basics of Twine, "an open source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories."
With your group, navigate to http://twinery.org/.

### Directions

Split into two groups: one with 3 members, one with 4

Navigate to https://perma.cc/W2PK-FCQT

After a brief introduction, we'll play the game separately in our groups.

- While you play, consider the following questions from Kiriloff's [Twine tutorial in the Programming Historian:](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/interactive-text-games-using-twine)

    1. What is the gameâ€™s argument?

    2. What design decisions (at the level of both narrative and mechanics) contribute to this argument?

    3. Who is the intended audience? What design decisions were made to engage this audience?

    4. What is the relationship between you, the player, and the player character (the character controlled by the player)?

- As an added constraint, you will only have 20 minutes to complete the game.

- If you reach the end and still have time, begin to play again with "debug mode" enabled.


Your group will briefly summarize your experience - tell us which ending you got!
We'll discuss the above analysis questions as a class.
