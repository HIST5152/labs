## Digital Storytelling in Five Frames

### Description

Effective digital storytelling incorporates multiple media and technologies to engage audiences with a narrative. This interplay of materials can enhance the transmission of ideas and emotions, and enrich possibilities for complex meaning-making and storytelling. We’ll be engaging in facilitated storytelling within a framework established by a long-running community of Flickr users, [Tell a Story in Five Frames](https://www.flickr.com/groups/visualstory/). We’ll be utilizing images made freely available by cultural institutions on that site to construct evocative stories based on primary source photographic evidence (a form of [remixing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix)). You’ll then present that story to your classmates using Google Slides, Canva, or another presentation software of your preference.

You can view an example story here that uses images from the Library of Congress: https://www.flickr.com/groups/visualstory/discuss/72157603786255599/

### Directions

To complete this assignment: 
You will choose a sequence of up to five photos that tell a story visually, as a whole. The subject matter is your choice, with the limitation that you’ll be sourcing images from the Flickr collections of cultural heritage institutions (Namely: 

- [The U.S. National Archive](https://www.flickr.com/people/usnationalarchives/)

- [The Library of Congres](https://www.flickr.com/people/library_of_congress/)

- [The New York Public Library](https://www.flickr.com/people/nypl/)


Each group will be assigned one of the above Flickr collections to work with. As a group, browse through the images, which are often contained in Albums or Galleries. You can also search within the collection: Click on Photostream, and then the magnifying glass icon. Choose a subject or theme to tell a story using images in your assigned collection. (Small and/or simple ideas will be easiest to execute within our time constraints.)

Choose up to five images that express the story’s theme or subject. You may (but are not required to) refer to [Syd Field’s Three-Act Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-act_structure) or other forms of [dramatic structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_structure) to help you in constructing an ordered narrative.

Choose an evocative and/or informative title for your story. Aside from attributions, the title will be the only textual element to guide your story. Try to get the point across with the images alone in the context of your story’s title.

Download your images and make a note of the attribution. It’s easy to download images from Flickr; simply choose a photo, click on it, and click the indicated symbol (image: https://cynthiaheider.com/wp/digitalhistory2021/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/flickr_download-scaled.jpg)

Create a presentation of your story construction in Google Slides, Canva, or another presentation software of your choice. Paste or insert the images you chose in the order you want them presented. Create an introductory slide with the title you’ve chosen.

Download your presentation/slide deck as a PDF and upload it to one member of your team's GitHub assignments folder.

Present your story to your classmates. First, show us the story. Then as we walk through a second time, talk about the choices you made to create the narrative or argument that drives your story.
